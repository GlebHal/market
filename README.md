# Market
## This is my training app in which I tried to create a market.
 Although there is some responsiveness in this app, I highly recommend **running the app on large screens**
 
## How to start
### Firstly
Install the dependencies by running the following command on the cmd in the project folder: `npm install`
### Secondly
Use the following command to start the app in the development mode: `npm run start`
#### Or
Use the following command to start the app in the production mode: `npm run build`
then go in the `build` folder and then use `npm run start`
### Thirdly
See the finished result by clicking on the following link: http://localhost:3000
